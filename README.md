This code is not to be intended for profit, it is just a didactic instrument that can be used by students or by professors in their loooong days of study on the exciting world of teletraffic.
 
This code is also open source and everybody can take and modify it, but I kindly ask you to let me know when this happens as well as I will be happy to be cited in the resulting project :)
